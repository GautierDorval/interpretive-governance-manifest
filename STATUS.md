Status: draft (constitution locked)
This repository defines a baseline layered governance model:
Layer 0 (Ontology), Layer 1 (Interpretive Governance), Layer 2 (Constraintive Governance).
The layered separation and regime boundary (web-open vs agentic-closed) are considered stable.
Future revisions may extend the model but must not redefine these baseline distinctions.
This repository is normative in definition and non-executable by design.
Reference implementations are non-normative and do not imply conformance.
