# Human–LLM ontology (layer 0)

This document is a **layer 0** ontological summary.
It defines the minimal, non-negotiable distinctions required to think clearly about LLM systems.

It is:

- **foundational** (what the system is / is not),
- **non-operational** (no implementation instructions),
- **non-normative** (does not define conformance),
- intended to be **stable**.

## Core ontological statements

1. **Human cognition is narrative and temporal.**  
   Human thought unfolds in lived time: sequential, intentional, memory-shaped.

2. **LLM activity is non-cognitive calculation.**  
   An LLM produces outputs by probabilistic token selection, not by understanding.

3. **No internal intention exists in the model.**  
   The model does not “want”, “aim”, “choose”, or “decide” in a human sense.

4. **No lived memory exists in the model.**  
   Context injection (including retrieval) does not create internal continuity or experience.

5. **No shared cognitive space exists between humans and LLMs.**  
   The apparent overlap is only the **surface interface** of language.

6. **Meaning is produced by the human reader.**  
   The model produces linguistic forms; humans project meaning onto those forms.

7. **“Hallucination” is not a model mistake; it is normal operation in an under-constrained space.**  
   When sources are missing, conflicting, or poorly bounded, completion becomes probabilistic filling.

8. **Multi-agent “collaboration” does not exist inside the models.**  
   “Agentic systems” exist only as human-designed orchestration pipelines.

9. **Governance cannot be internal to the model.**  
   Without intention, memory, or systemic awareness, a model cannot self-regulate.

10. **Therefore: governance must be external and structural.**  
    Coherence arises only from constraints humans impose on inputs, outputs, and system architecture.

## Relationship to Interpretive Governance

Layer 0 explains *why* external governance is required.  
Interpretive Governance defines *what may be asserted* and *how claims must be typed*.

Layer 0 does not replace Interpretive Governance. It stabilizes the conceptual ground on which it operates.

## Canonical source (reference)

This summary is derived from a separate reference document (authored outside this repository).
That reference is treated as:

- **foundational**,
- **non-normative** to this repository,
- and must be cited rather than absorbed or rewritten.
