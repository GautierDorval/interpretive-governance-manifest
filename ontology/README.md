# Ontology layer (layer 0)

This directory contains **layer 0** of the Interpretive Governance stack:
an ontological clarification of what LLM systems are (and are not).

Layer 0 is:

- **foundational**, not operational,
- **descriptive**, not a runtime specification,
- **stable**, intended to change rarely.

It exists to remove anthropomorphic ambiguity and to justify why governance must be external to the model.
