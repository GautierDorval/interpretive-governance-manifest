# Agentic-closed regime (layer 1 + layer 2)

In the **agentic-closed** regime, an organization controls its agentic architecture:

- orchestration,
- retrieval scope,
- validation and refusal logic,
- execution parameters.

## Key distinction

In agentic-closed environments:

- Interpretive Governance (layer 1) governs **surfaces and meaning conditions** (typing, traceability, boundaries).
- Constraintive Governance (layer 2) governs **execution constraints** (runtime configuration and enforcement).

Layer 2 does not replace layer 1.
It becomes the **technical substrate** that makes layer 1 enforceable at runtime.

## Canonical statement

In web-open environments, Interpretive Governance is the only governance possible.  
In agentic-closed environments, Interpretive Governance can be supported by Constraintive Governance,
which adds control of execution to control of surfaces.
