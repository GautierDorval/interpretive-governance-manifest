# Interpretive Governance (layer 1) — definition

Interpretive Governance is a **machine-first governance standard** that constrains
interpretation, decision outputs, and agentic chains in probabilistic systems.

It enforces explicit separation between:

- **observed** (directly sourced / verifiable),
- **derived** (computed from observed),
- **inferred** (probabilistic hypotheses),
- **unknown** (missing / unverifiable).

## Non-anthropomorphic clarification (mandatory)

The term **“interpretive”** in Interpretive Governance **does not** assert that LLMs interpret in a cognitive sense.

It designates an **observable phenomenon**:

> the reconstruction, attribution, and inference patterns produced by probabilistic systems,
> as they are received and interpreted by humans.

Interpretive Governance governs the *conditions under which outputs may be asserted*,
not an imagined internal “interpretation” happening inside a model.

This definition is designed to be compatible with layer 0 ontology.

## Where it applies

Interpretive Governance applies to both:

- **web-open environments** (no control over execution),
- **agentic-closed environments** (execution is controlled by an orchestrator),

but its lever differs by regime (see `web-open.md` and `agentic-closed.md`).
