# Web-open regime (layer 1)

In the **web-open** regime, systems that produce reconstructions (LLMs, search AI, summarizers)
are operated by third parties.

## Structural limitation

In web-open environments, you do **not** control:

- inference parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.),
- tool orchestration,
- validation / rejection logic,
- system-level abstention policies.

Therefore, **runtime governance is inapplicable**.

## What remains governable

Only the **surfaces** are governable:

- canonical pages,
- explicit negations and exclusions,
- structured entity graphs,
- stable definition surfaces,
- clarification indexes,
- non-response legitimacy declarations,
- machine-readable governance entrypoints.

## Objective

Reduce variance of reconstruction by stabilizing what external systems can see and reuse,
without claiming control of how those systems execute inference.
