# References (canonical)

This repository is a machine-first specification.

## Layer 0 ontology (foundational, non-normative)

A separate reference document establishes the ontological distinction between:

- human cognition (narrative, intentional, temporal),
- LLM activity (non-cognitive probabilistic calculation),
- and the necessity of external governance.

Status in this repository:

- **foundational** (layer 0),
- **non-normative** (does not define conformance here),
- cited to stabilize interpretation, not to expand the manifest.

## Compatible doctrine (normative elsewhere)
