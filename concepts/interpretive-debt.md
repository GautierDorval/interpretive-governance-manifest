# Interpretive debt (dette interprétative)

**Status:** canonical concept (doctrinal reference)

## Canonical definition (one sentence)

Interpretive debt is a cumulative liability created when high-impact approximations are repeated and stabilized by interpretive systems, becoming a default representation that is harder to dislodge than it was to prevent.

## Mechanism (minimal)

1. Initial approximation (plausible, slightly over-broad, or under-bounded)
2. Repetition across contexts (answers, summaries, comparisons)
3. Apparent stabilization (reused because it “works”)
4. Anchoring (becomes a default interpretive handle)
5. Debt (correction becomes multi-surface de-anchoring)
