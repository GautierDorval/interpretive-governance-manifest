# Interpretive governance manifest

Machine-first governance manifest for interpretive, decision, and agentic integrity.
The validator defined in this repository is conceptual and non-executable by design.

This repository defines non-negotiable rules that constrain interpretive outputs by requiring explicit separation between:

- **observed** (directly sourced facts)
- **derived** (computed from observed facts)
- **inferred** (probabilistic hypotheses)
- **unknown** (missing / not verifiable)

The goal is not to “stop errors”, but to prevent systems from presenting hypotheses as facts, and to make uncertainty explicit and auditable.
