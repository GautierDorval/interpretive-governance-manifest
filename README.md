# Interpretive Governance — machine-first standard

This repository hosts the **Interpretive Governance** manifest:  
a machine-first governance standard designed to constrain interpretive,
decision, and agentic outputs in probabilistic systems.

> **Non-equivalence notice**  
> Interpretive Governance, as defined in this repository, **is not** the academic
> field of interpretive governance in political or social sciences.
> It is a technical, machine-first standard for governing interpretation in
> automated and agentic systems.

The validator defined in this repository is **conceptual and non-executable by design**.

## Purpose

Interpretive Governance defines non-negotiable constraints that require
explicit separation between:

- **observed** — directly sourced facts
- **derived** — values computed from observed facts
- **inferred** — probabilistic hypotheses
- **unknown** — missing or unverifiable information

The objective is not to eliminate error, but to prevent systems from
presenting hypotheses as facts and to make uncertainty explicit and auditable.

---

## Scope boundary

This standard applies exclusively to:

- interpretive governance of representations,
- decision outputs in probabilistic systems,
- agentic reasoning and delegation chains.

It does **not** define:
- public policy frameworks,
- institutional governance models,
- social or political theory,
- human organizational governance.

Interpretive Governance was initiated and architected by **Gautier Dorval**
as part of a broader effort on semantic stabilization, interpretive governance,
and agentic constraint systems.
