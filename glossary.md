# Glossary (canonical)

This glossary prevents category errors and anthropomorphic drift.

## Interpretation (strong sense)

Human production of meaning based on:

- lived temporality,
- intention,
- experience,
- memory and continuity.

## Reconstruction (operational sense)

Observable outputs produced by probabilistic systems when they:

- assemble descriptions,
- attribute roles,
- merge sources,
- fill missing gaps by statistical completion.

This is not cognition.
It is an observable reconstruction effect.

## Inference

A probabilistic hypothesis not directly supported by evidence.

Inference must be explicitly typed and must never be presented as observed fact.

## Unknown

Missing, undefined, or unverifiable information.

Unknowns must remain explicit; they must not be silently completed.

## Constraintive Governance

Runtime governance by bounding computation and emission:

- parameters,
- validation,
- abstention,
- retrieval boundaries,
- orchestration rules.

Applicable only in agentic-closed environments.

## Interpretive Governance

Governance of claim legitimacy and typing:

- observed / derived / inferred / unknown,
- traceability over plausibility,
- legitimate non-response when conditions are missing.

Applicable in both web-open and agentic-closed environments, but with different levers.
