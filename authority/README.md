# Authority governance (Layer 3)

This directory defines **normative, machine-first** specifications governing **executable authority**.

## Core boundary

**Inference never implies authority.**

A response can be correct and still remain non-authorized to execute.

## Required primitives (normative)

- Boundary: `inference-vs-authority.md`
- Action taxonomy: `action-taxonomy.json`
- Proof model: `proof-model.md`
- Authority policy: `authority-policy.json`
- Authority ledger spec: `authority-ledger-spec.md`

## Coordination and integrity (normative)

- Role topology: `role-topology.md`
- Incentive integrity: `incentive-integrity.md`

## Non-objectives

- `non-objectives.md`
  This repository defines contracts, not execution recipes.
