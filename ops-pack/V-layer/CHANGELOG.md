# CHANGELOG — ops-pack (V-Layer)

## 1.1.0

- Added Integrity locking (artifact hashing) as an optional V-Layer mechanism.
- Introduced SHA-256 fingerprinting guidance for critical machine-first artifacts.
- Clarified scope: integrity hashes are drift-control signals, not authority proofs.
- Added integrity-locks.md to formalize artifact fingerprint discipline.

## 1.0.0

- Initial publication of V-Layer: versioning, drift, and change control.
