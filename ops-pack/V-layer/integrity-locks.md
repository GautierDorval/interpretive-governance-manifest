# Integrity locks (SHA-256)

This document defines optional integrity fingerprints for critical machine-first artifacts.

## Rule
When an integrity lock is published, it MUST reflect the SHA-256 of the raw bytes as served publicly.

## What it is
- A publicly verifiable integrity fingerprint for a published artifact version.

## What it is not
- Not a signature.
- Not a proof of authority.
- Not a compliance claim.
