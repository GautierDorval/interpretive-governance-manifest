# Agentic operations pack (minimal)

This directory defines **operational extensions** required to support production-grade authority governance.

This pack does not redefine doctrine.
It provides runtime-facing primitives that make authority governance maintainable and defensible in real environments.

## Minimal pack modules

- H-Layer: `H-layer/human-oversight-protocol.md`
- P-Layer: `P-layer/privacy-data-lineage.md`
- V-Layer: `V-layer/versioning-drift-change-control.md`
- S-Layer: `S-layer/security-abuse-resistance.md`
- IR-Layer: `IR-layer/incident-response.md`

## Non-goals

This pack does not provide:
- orchestrator implementations
- tool wiring patterns
- deployment playbooks
- bypass or exploitation guidance
