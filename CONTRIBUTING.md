# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Interpretive Governance.

This repository is a **normative, machine-first standard**. Contributions are welcome, but no change is normative until explicitly ratified and released.

## Where to start

- Read: `README.md`
- Onboarding: `GETTING-STARTED.md`
- Change control: `GOVERNANCE.md`

## How to contribute

1) Open an issue describing the problem or proposal.
2) If needed, submit a pull request referencing the issue.
3) For any critical change, update:
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `integrity/hashes.json` (when critical artifacts change)

## Non-goals

This repository does not accept changes that:
- blur scope boundaries into policy frameworks or institutional governance,
- introduce certification claims,
- remove canonical stability guarantees without a clear migration plan.
