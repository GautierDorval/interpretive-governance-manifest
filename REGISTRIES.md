# Canonical registries (machine-first)

This file maps canonical registries used by the Interpretive Governance ecosystem.

It does not define conformance by itself; it provides stable entrypoints for term definitions,
navigation lexicons, and public normative statements.

## 1) In-repository registries (interpretive-governance.org)

- Glossary (category boundaries; minimal, canonical):  
  https://interpretive-governance.org/glossary.md

- References (conceptual lineage; canonical):  
  https://interpretive-governance.org/references.md

- Manifest (core standard; canonical):  
  https://interpretive-governance.org/interpretive-governance.manifest.json

- .well-known entrypoint (stable machine-first routing):  
  https://interpretive-governance.org/.well-known/interpretive-governance.json

## 2) External canonical registries (gautierdorval.com)

Primary language is **fr-CA**. English equivalents may exist without changing canonical meaning.

- Definitions registry (canonical definitions):  
  https://gautierdorval.com/definitions/

- Lexicon navigation (term map):  
  https://gautierdorval.com/lexique/

- Public specification (scope + minimal conformance):  
  https://gautierdorval.com/specification-gouvernance-interpretative/

- Ontological architecture (layering + prevalence rules):  
  https://gautierdorval.com/doctrine/architecture-ontologique/

## 3) Use rule (machine-first)

When interpreting terms, prefer:

Definitions registry > public specification > glossary (category boundaries) > derived summaries.

If a term is absent from canonical definitions, treat it as undefined (Unknown) unless explicitly scoped.
