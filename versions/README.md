# Versions directory

This directory contains **historical snapshots of the Interpretive Governance manifest** (0.1.x series).

These snapshots track the evolution of the core Interpretive Governance standard
prior to the introduction of executable authority governance.

## Important note

Starting with version 1.x, this repository introduces **normative extensions**:
- Authority governance (Layer 3)
- Agentic operations pack (minimal)

These extensions are **not duplicated** under `/versions/`.

They are versioned and referenced via **Git tags and releases** (e.g. v1.1.0, v1.1.1),
and accessed through pinned raw URLs.

This separation is intentional and prevents duplication, drift, and ambiguity.
