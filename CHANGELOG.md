## 1.1.0 — Authority governance (Layer 3) + ops pack (minimal)

- Introduced **Authority governance (Layer 3)**:
  - `authority/inference-vs-authority.md`
  - `authority/action-taxonomy.json`
  - `authority/proof-model.md`
  - `authority/authority-policy.json`
  - `authority/authority-ledger-spec.md`
  - `authority/role-topology.md`
  - `authority/incentive-integrity.md`
  - `authority/non-objectives.md`

- Introduced **Agentic operations pack (minimal)**:

  - `ops-pack/P-layer/privacy-data-lineage.md`
  - `ops-pack/V-layer/versioning-drift-change-control.md`
  - `ops-pack/S-layer/security-abuse-resistance.md`

agentic systems, without redefining the interpretive core.
