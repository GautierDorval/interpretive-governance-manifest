# Constraintive Governance (layer 2) — definition

Constraintive Governance is a **structural, runtime-only governance layer** applicable
exclusively in **agentic-closed** environments.

It is best understood as:

> a normative configuration of execution that bounds what the system is permitted to compute and emit.

It is:

- not interpretive,
- not cognitive,
- not adaptive by itself,
- and not applicable to web-open environments.

## What it governs

Constraintive Governance governs:

1. **Input space**  
   what the system is allowed to see (retrieval scope, source allowlists, exclusions)

2. **Output space**  
   what the system is allowed to emit (formats, schemas, prohibitions, bounded variability)

3. **Execution conditions**  
   parameters, validation, retry rules, abstention thresholds, orchestration routing

## Why it exists

Because models do not self-stabilize, runtime coherence must be external.
Constraintive Governance is the practical mechanism that enforces that external coherence
in controlled environments.

## Relationship to Interpretive Governance

- Interpretive Governance governs *claim typing, traceability, and legitimacy conditions*.
- Constraintive Governance governs *execution bounds*.

In agentic-closed systems, layer 2 is the **technical substrate** that allows layer 1 to be enforced reliably.
